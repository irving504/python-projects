# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of Python projects I‚Äôve built as part of my academic journey in Business Analytics, coursework in Introduction to Programming (Python), and self-driven learning.

These projects range from simple logic-based programs to applied scripts involving encryption, financial calculations, file handling, and game design. Each script is designed to demonstrate core programming concepts and practical problem-solving using Python.

## üìÅ Project Highlights

| Project Folder                | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `grade_input_validation`     | A script that accepts grade inputs and validates user entries to calculate averages. Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and input checking. |
| `caesar_cipher`              | Encrypts and decrypts user messages using Caesar cipher logic. Demonstrates string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and ASCII logic. |
| `rock_paper_scissors`        | A simple game where a user plays rock-paper-scissors against a computer opponent. Includes logic branching and user input. |
| `zodiac_sign`                | Determines a user's zodiac sign based on birth month and day. Reinforces if/else logic and date-based conditions. |
| `tuition_projection`         | Calculates and displays projected tuition over 10 years. Demonstrates use of loops, formatted output, and compound interest logic. |
| `coin_converter`             | Converts cents into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Focuses on math operations, division, and modulus. |
| `file_based_projects`        | Includes programs that read from/write to `.txt` files ‚Äî such as storing movie lists, analyzing random numbers, or amino acid mappings. |
| `math_practice_game`         | A basic interactive math quiz game that uses random numbers and scoring logic. Useful for control flow and repetition. |
| `cancer_classification`      | Used scikit-learn and  Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on real-world datasets.|
| `pandas_basic`               | Explored foundational data wrangling using pandas, including DataFrame creation, filtering, and basic analysis.|

## üß† Why This Matters

This repository reflects my hands-on learning journey as I build toward a career in **data science and analytics**. These foundational projects have strengthened my logic-building skills, helped me communicate with code, and prepared me for more advanced topics like data analysis, visualization, and automation.

## üöÄ Next Steps

In future commits, I plan to:
- Organize projects into individual folders with READMEs
- Refactor some projects for improved structure and style
- Expand the repository with beginner data analysis notebooks using Python and pandas
